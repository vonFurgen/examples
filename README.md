Occupancy application

The codes are implemented in Python without external libs on RedHat Linux.
To execute the client-server application:
1. Download the files in /tmp folder or any other directory
2. Open three instances of linux terminal
3. Change server_ip according your local IP in both (client and server).
4. Change client_id
5. To change occupancy data and position on client side. Find the dataset function and change sensorData array to change the occupancy or posData to change the position as a tuple
6. Save changes :)
7. Execute server.py, client0.py and client1.py separately in every terminal.
# python server.py
# python client0.py
# python cleint1.py
8 If you want to create more client. copy paste a single client and jump to step 3,4,5 and 6 :)
